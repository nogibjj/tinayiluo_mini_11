Individual Project #3: Databricks ETL (Extract Transform Load) Pipeline
Lead Instructor: Noah Gift
Requirements
Your project should include the following:
* A well-documented Databricks notebook that performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, checked into the repository.
* Usage of Delta Lake for data storage.
* Usage of Spark SQL for data transformations.
* Proper error handling and data validation.
* Visualization of the transformed data.
* An automated trigger to initiate the pipeline.
* README.md: A file that clearly explains what the project does, its dependencies, how to run the program, and concludes with actionable and data-driven recommendations to a hypothetical management team.
* Video Demo: A YouTube link in README.md showing a clear, concise walkthrough and demonstration of your ETL pipeline, including the automated trigger and recommendations to the management team.
Grading Rubric
Your project will be graded on the following criteria:
* Databricks ETL Pipeline (20 points): Your Databricks notebook correctly extracts data, performs transformations, and loads the data into a final output.
    * Extract operation (7 points): Your notebook correctly extracts data from the source data.
    * Transform operation (7 points): Your notebook correctly transforms the extracted data.
    * Load operation (6 points): Your notebook correctly loads the transformed data into the destination data store.
* Usage of Delta Lake (20 points): Your ETL pipeline correctly utilizes Delta Lake for data storage.
    * Correct setup and usage of Delta Lake (10 points): Your notebook correctly sets up Delta Lake and uses it to store the transformed data.
    * Data validation checks (10 points): Your notebook includes data validation checks to ensure the quality of the data.
* Usage of Spark SQL (20 points): Your pipeline effectively utilizes Spark SQL for data transformations.
    * Correct use of Spark SQL (10 points): Your notebook correctly uses Spark SQL to perform the data transformations.
    * Effectiveness of data transformations (10 points): The data transformations are effective in cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
* Visualization and Conclusion (15 points): Your project includes a visualization of the transformed data and a data-driven, actionable recommendation for a management team, both in the notebook and README.md.
    * Quality of data visualization (7 points): The visualization is clear, concise, and effective in communicating the results of the data analysis.
    * Actionable, data-driven recommendation (8 points): The recommendation is based on the results of the data analysis and is actionable by the management team.
* README.md (10 points): The README.md file is clear, concise, and guides the user on how to run the program and includes the conclusion and recommendation.
    * Clarity and completeness (5 points): The README.md file is easy to read and understand and includes all the information necessary 
* to run the program.
* Inclusion of conclusion and recommendation (5 points): The README.md file includes the conclusion and recommendation from the project.
* Automated Trigger (10 points): Your project includes an automated trigger to initiate the pipeline, demonstrated in the video.
    * Correct setup of the trigger (5 points): The trigger is correctly set up to initiate the pipeline on a schedule or event.
    * Effective demonstration in video (5 points): The video demonstrates the correct setup and usage of the trigger.
* Demo Video (5 points): A 2-5 minute video explaining the project and demonstrating its functionality is included. The video should be high-quality (both audio and visual), not exceed the given time limit, and be linked in the README via a private or public YouTube link.
    * Clarity of explanation (2 points): The video clearly explains the project and its functionality.
    * Quality demonstration of the project (2 points): The video demonstrates the project and its functionality in a clear and concise manner.
    * Quality of video and audio (1 point): The video is high-quality and easy to understand.
